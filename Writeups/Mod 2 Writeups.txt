Room 1: What is Networking?

What I Learned:

Introduction to Networking:
- Networking is the connection of devices to share data and resources
- The Internet is a global network connecting millions of networks
- Networks enable communication between computers worldwide

Key Networking Concepts:

IP Addresses:
- Unique identifier for devices on a network
- IPv4: 192.168.1.1 format (4 numbers, 0-255 each)
- IPv6: Longer format to accommodate more devices
- Public IP: Visible on the internet
- Private IP: Used within local networks (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16.x.x)

MAC Addresses:
- Physical hardware address burned into network interface card
- Format: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF (6 pairs of hexadecimal)
- Unique to each network device
- Used for communication within local networks

Protocols:
- Rules that govern how data is transmitted
- Common protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, DNS
- Protocols work at different layers of networking

Ping Command:
- Tests connectivity between devices
- Sends ICMP packets to target
- Shows if device is reachable and response time
- Usage: ping 192.168.1.1

Key Understanding:
Networks are the backbone of modern computing. Every device needs unique identifiers (IP and MAC) to communicate effectively.

===============================================================================

Room 2: Intro to LAN

What I Learned:

LAN (Local Area Network):
- Network within limited area (home, office, building)
- Devices connected to share resources
- Faster speeds than WAN (Wide Area Network)

Network Topologies:

1. Star Topology:
   Structure: All devices connect to central hub/switch
   Advantages:
   - Easy to add new devices
   - If one device fails, others unaffected
   - Easy to troubleshoot
   
   Disadvantages:
   - If central device fails, whole network down
   - Requires more cable than bus topology

2. Bus Topology:
   Structure: All devices connected to single cable (backbone)
   Advantages:
   - Easy to set up
   - Requires less cable
   
   Disadvantages:
   - If backbone fails, whole network down
   - Difficult to troubleshoot
   - Performance degrades with more devices

3. Ring Topology:
   Structure: Devices connected in circular loop
   Advantages:
   - Data flows in one direction (less collision)
   - Equal access for all devices
   
   Disadvantages:
   - If one device fails, can affect whole network
   - Difficult to add/remove devices

Network Devices:

Router:
- Connects different networks together
- Routes data between networks
- Assigns IP addresses (DHCP)
- Provides security (firewall)
- Works at Layer 3 (Network Layer)

Switch:
- Connects devices within same network
- Uses MAC addresses to forward data
- More intelligent than hub
- Works at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)
- Each port is separate collision domain

Hub:
- Basic device that broadcasts to all ports
- No intelligence in forwarding
- All ports share same collision domain
- Rarely used today (replaced by switches)

Key Understanding:
Star topology is most common in modern networks due to its reliability and ease of management.
Switches are preferred over hubs for better performance.

===============================================================================

Room 3: OSI Model

What I Learned:

OSI Model Overview:
- Open Systems Interconnection model
- 7 layers that describe network communication
- Data flows from Layer 7 down to Layer 1 (sending)
- Data flows from Layer 1 up to Layer 7 (receiving)
- Each layer has specific function

The 7 Layers:

Layer 7 - Application Layer:
- User-facing applications and services
- Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS
- Where user interacts with network
- Examples: Web browsers, email clients
- Data unit: Data

Layer 6 - Presentation Layer:
- Data translation and encryption
- Converts data formats for application layer
- Handles compression and encryption
- Ensures data is readable format
- Examples: SSL/TLS, JPEG, ASCII
- Data unit: Data

Layer 5 - Session Layer:
- Manages sessions between applications
- Establishes, maintains, and terminates connections

- Synchronization of data exchange
- Examples: NetBIOS, PPTP
- Data unit: Data

Layer 4 - Transport Layer:
- End-to-end communication and data flow control
- Segments data and ensures delivery
- Protocols: TCP (reliable), UDP (fast)
- Port numbers identify applications
- Error checking and flow control
- Data unit: Segments (TCP) or Datagrams (UDP)

Layer 3 - Network Layer:
- Routing and logical addressing
- Uses IP addresses for addressing
- Determines best path for data
- Handles packet forwarding
- Protocols: IP, ICMP, IGMP

Layer 1 - Physical Layer:
- Physical transmission of raw bits
- Cables, network cards, wireless signals
- Electrical signals, light, radio waves
- Hardware specifications
- Examples: Cables, hubs, repeaters
- Data unit: Bits

Encapsulation Process:
Application → Presentation → Session → Transport (Segments) → Network (Packets) → Data Link (Frames) → Physical (Bits)

De-encapsulation Process:
Physical (Bits) → Data Link (Frames) → Network (Packets) → Transport (Segments) → Session → Presentation → Application

Mnemonic to Remember:
Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application)
All People Seem To Need Data Processing (reverse order)

Key Understanding:
OSI model is theoretical framework.
Understanding it helps troubleshoot network issues and understand how protocols interact at different levels.

- Used within local network
- Include error checking (CRC)

Packet Structure:

IP Header contains:
- Source IP address
- Destination IP address
- TTL (Time To Live): Prevents infinite loops

- FCS (Frame Check Sequence): Error detection

TCP Protocol:

Features:
- Connection-oriented (establishes connection first)
- Reliable delivery (guarantees data arrives)
- Error checking and correction
- Flow control
- Used when accuracy is critical

TCP 3-Way Handshake:
1. SYN: Client sends synchronization request
2. SYN-ACK: Server acknowledges and sends own SYN
3. ACK: Client acknowledges server's SYN
Connection established!

TCP Header includes:
- Source port
- Destination port
- Sequence number
- Acknowledgment number
- Flags (SYN, ACK, FIN, RST)
- Window size
- Checksum

UDP Protocol:

- Faster than TCP
- No error checking or flow control
- Used for speed-critical applications

UDP Header includes:
- Source port
- Destination port
- Length
- Checksum
- Much simpler than TCP

TCP vs UDP Comparison:

TCP:
- Reliable
- Connection-oriented
- Slower
- Error checking
- Used for: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, Email

UDP:
- Unreliable
- Connectionless
- Faster
- No error checking
- Used for: Video streaming, VoIP, Online gaming, DNS

Common Port Numbers:
- 20/21: FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
- 22: SSH (Secure Shell)
- 23: Telnet
- 25: SMTP (Email sending)
- 53: DNS (Domain Name System)

Room 5: Extending Your Network

What I Learned:

Port Forwarding:
- Technique to allow external access to services on private network
- Router forwards specific port to internal device
- Example: Forward port 80 to web server at 192.168.1.10
- Used for hosting servers, gaming, remote access
- Security consideration: Opens potential attack vector

Firewalls:
- Security device that filters network traffic
- Controls incoming and outgoing connections
- Rules based on IP addresses, ports, protocols

Types:
- Stateless: Examines each packet independently
- Stateful: Tracks connection state, more intelligent
- Application-level: Inspects application layer data

Common Rules:
- Allow HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) outbound
- Block all inbound except specific services
- Allow established connections
- Block known malicious IPs

VPN (Virtual Private Network):
- Creates encrypted tunnel over public network
- Hides real IP address
- Encrypts all traffic between user and VPN server
- Provides privacy and security

Benefits:
- Secure remote access to company networks
- Privacy from ISP and network monitoring
- Access geo-restricted content
- Secure public WiFi usage

How VPN Works:
1. User connects to VPN server
2. Encrypted tunnel established
3. All traffic routed through VPN server
4. VPN server forwards traffic to destination
5. Responses come back through VPN
6. User receives encrypted data

VPN Protocols:
- OpenVPN: Open source, very secure
- IPSec: Industry standard, secure
- WireGuard: Modern, fast, secure
- PPTP: Old, not recommended (insecure)

Subnetting:
- Dividing network into smaller networks (subnets)
- Improves performance and security
- Uses subnet mask to define network portion

Example:
192.168.1.0/24
- /24 means first 24 bits are network
- Last 8 bits for hosts
- 256 addresses (254 usable, 2 reserved)

Private IP Ranges:
- 10.0.0.0/8: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255
- 172.16.0.0/12: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255
- 192.168.0.0/16: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

NAT (Network Address Translation):
- Allows multiple devices share one public IP
- Router translates private IPs to public IP
- Provides basic security (hides internal network)
- Essential for IPv4 address conservation

DMZ (Demilitarized Zone):
- Separate network segment for public-facing services
- Adds extra security layer
- Web servers, mail servers placed in DMZ
- Isolated from internal network

Key Understanding:
Extending networks requires balancing accessibility with security.
Port forwarding opens access but creates risks. VPNs provide secure remote access.
Firewalls are essential for network security.
