Room 1: Introduction to Offensive Security

What I Learned:

Offensive Security Overview:
- Offensive security means testing systems by simulating real attacks
- The goal is to find vulnerabilities before malicious hackers do
- Always requires written authorization before testing
- Must stay within defined scope

Penetration Testing Phases:
1. Reconnaissance: Gather information about the target
2. Scanning: Identify open ports and services
3. Exploitation: Attempt to gain access using found vulnerabilities
4. Post-Exploitation: Maintain access and gather data
5. Reporting: Document all findings with remediation recommendations

Tools Introduced:
- GoBuster: Used for directory enumeration
- Burp Suite: Web application security testing
- Nmap: Network scanning and port discovery
- Metasploit: Exploitation framework

Practical Exercise:
- Tested a sample web application for vulnerabilities
- Used GoBuster to find hidden directories
- Discovered an admin panel with weak security
- Learned how to document findings properly

Key Understanding:
Ethical hacking is legal and helps improve security.
The difference between ethical hackers and malicious hackers is authorization and intent.

Important Rules:
- Always get written permission
- Stay within the defined scope
- Document everything thoroughly
- Provide actionable remediation advice
- Never cause harm to systems

===============================================================================

2. Detection & Analysis: Identify and investigate incidents
3. Containment: Limit damage and prevent spread
4. Eradication: Remove the threat from environment
5. Recovery: Restore systems to normal operation
6. Post-Incident Activity: Learn from incident and improve

Malware Analysis:
Understanding how malicious software works

Types:
- Static Analysis: Examine malware without executing it
- Dynamic Analysis: Run malware in controlled/sandbox environment
- Code Analysis: Reverse engineering to understand behavior

Tools Used:
- SIEM: Splunk, QRadar, ELK Stack for log management
